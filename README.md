# Installation

The required python package includes: pyspark, seaborn, and pandas.

# Project Motivation
Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped using the company's services. It is normal for companies to lose and gain customers, however preventing churn is important because it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing customers.
This project main objective is to build a model that can detect churn based on user events.

# File Description

Sparkify.ipynb - This file contains the analysis and model training done for this project.

# Result

Three classifier algorithms are trained to detect possible churn users: logistic regression, random forest, and gradient-boosted tree regression.
